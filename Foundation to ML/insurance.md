## Overview
This notebook performs a complete end‑to‑end analysis on the `insurance.csv` dataset. It covers exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning and preprocessing, feature engineering, scaling, feature selection, model training, and basic evaluation. The goal is to build a simple regression model to predict insurance charges and provide guidance for improvements.

## Dataset
- File: `insurance.csv`
- Contains demographic and medical information (age, sex, BMI, children, smoker, region) and target variable `charges`.

## Dependencies
Recommended Python packages:
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- scipy

(Install via pip: pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn scipy)

## Notebook Structure
1. Environment
    - Check Python version and import libraries.
2. Load Data
    - Read `insurance.csv` into a Pandas DataFrame and inspect contents.
3. EDA
    - Inspect shape, head, info, describe, nulls and columns.
    - Visualize distributions (histograms, KDEs), boxplots, counts, and correlation heatmap.
4. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
    - Create a working copy, drop duplicates, confirm missing values and dtypes.
    - Map binary categorical columns (`sex`, `smoker`) to numeric flags.
    - One‑hot encode `region`.
5. Feature Engineering
    - Create BMI categories (underweight/normal/overweight/obese) with pd.cut.
    - One‑hot encode BMI category columns.
6. Feature Scaling
    - Standardize numerical features (`age`, `bmi`, `children`) using StandardScaler.
7. Feature Selection
    - Compute Pearson correlations between numeric features and `charges`.
    - For categorical features, perform chi‑square tests against binned charges to decide inclusion.
8. Prepare Final Dataset
    - Select final feature set (e.g., age, is_female, bmi, children, is_smoker, region_southeast, bmi_category_obese, charges).
9. Modeling & Evaluation
    - Split data into train/test and train a Linear Regression model.
    - Evaluate using R² and Adjusted R².
10. Next Steps
    - Analyze coefficients and feature importance.
    - Try regularization (Ridge, Lasso), cross‑validation, and alternative models (RandomForest, XGBoost).
    - Consider model persistence and deployment.

## How to Use
1. Open `foundation.ipynb` in JupyterLab/Jupyter Notebook.
2. Ensure `insurance.csv` is in the same directory.
3. Run cells sequentially. Cells are organized to be runnable in order.
4. Review visualizations and printed outputs to understand intermediate results.

## Notes & Tips
- The notebook intentionally suppresses warnings for cleaner output; re-enable if debugging.
- Binning `charges` for chi‑square tests discretizes the target—interpret results accordingly.
- When converting dtypes to `int`, be mindful of non‑integer columns (use only when appropriate).
- Scale numeric features before models sensitive to feature scale.

## Suggested Improvements
- Add cross‑validation and hyperparameter search.
- Evaluate additional metrics (MAE, RMSE).
- Implement pipelines to combine preprocessing and modeling.
- Expand feature engineering (interaction terms, polynomial features).
- Document assumptions and track experiments with a versioning tool.
